# 7WC - Intro to Unity3D
This is a repository designed to introduce students to the Unity 3D Platform. The following is a lesson plan made for Massey's 7 Week Challenge:

## Introduction
Unity is a great platform used for building a variety of applications. From Game to Medical Applications, Unity is a multiplatform tool that has use even in professional standards. Personally, I have used Unity for 3 years and I find that it is my preferred tool for building programming in general. This week in the 7 Week Challenge, I will be bringing you through Unity primarily through a Game Development viewpoint, but do not think that Unity can only be used in this field further down the line.
